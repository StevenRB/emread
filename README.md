# emread
CLI program to convert a .eml file to .html and launches it
in the os's default browser. This is a limited use case but
I've found it is helpful as a Linux user who works with Outlook
users attaching .eml files


usage:  emread [options] <inputFilename>

options:

--help           displays this dialogue

--o "filename"   specifies the output filename

--s              suppresses the automatic browser launch

--d              deletes the html file once launched
